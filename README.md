# Databases_Assignments
This repository will just contain a few of my databases assignments that I worked on, simply to show case my understanding of SQL and a general understanding of how databases works. All assignments were linked to Northern Illinois University servers and were used to manipulated databases created by my professor. The SQL framework used by CSCI-466 was the MariaDB for SQL.
